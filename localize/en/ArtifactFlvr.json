Upon Glaciela's arrival in the village, she learned of some mischievous monsters destroying the village's crops and felt compelled to lend a hand. With Glaciela pitching in, the monsters were driven away and peace was brought back to the village. To show their gratitude for her contribution, the villagers presented her with a breathtaking sword forged using ore from among their most valued, ancient treasures. Tales speak of the divine protection dwelling within the ore that was bestowed by the region's ocean deity, and of how the precious mineralâ€”which can no longer be minedâ€”was sought out by all warriors once upon a time.

This special, one-of-a-kind article given to Eliza by Helena was dyed its vibrant crimson color with a rare species of rose, which is now considered to be extinct. The protection granted by these roses, said to have bloomed only in the sacred lands of old, flows through the very fabric of the garment, making it hard for most blows to even leave a scratch despite its elegant appearance. Additionally, the delicate rose engravings of the armored sections are inscribed with unseen charms, enhancing its defensive capabilities even further."

Its weight is nearly unnoticeable, and the sound of it cutting through the air is inaudible, making it the perfect tool for silent assassinations. This cursed weapon's long history includes countless victims, and it is said that the unfortunate souls it claims are not even aware of the blade passing through them when they breathe their last breath."
