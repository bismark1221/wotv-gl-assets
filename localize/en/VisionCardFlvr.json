{"infos":[{"key":"VC_LW_GLEM","value":"　In an age where magic and science have been fused together to develop new technology, feats such as granting immortality and awakening inanimate objects are no longer mere fantasy. It is this technology that has breathed life into the Rock Cliff Titan, Golem. Though it can act of its own volition, the Golem's behavior must always conform with the orders given by its creator. As long as those orders are upheld, the Golem will eagerly lend its strength to those with whom it finds commonality."},{"key":"VC_LW_IFRT","value":"　Sporting enormous horns and a fiercely muscular body, this savage esper wraps itself in a whirlwind of raging flames. It lives for the fight and assaults anything foolish enough to oppose it, occasionally transforming into a massive burst of fire that burns its enemies to a crisp. Though Ifrit's temperament is unstable at best, it will utterly devote itself to helping others—provided, of course, that it deems their passion worthy of such assistance."},{"key":"VC_LW_SIRE","value":"　A female esper known to use her beautiful singing voice to lure sailors into the water. At times, only her voice can be heard, yet she may also appear in the form of a beautiful young maiden and sing as if gently whispering into the listener's ears. Many consider her birdlike wings to be proof that she is an angel incarnate. However, those beguiled by the Siren have naught awaiting them but a sure death and a ticket to hell."},{"key":"VC_LW_SOKYU","value":"　Both of Leonis's princes oversee their own division. While Prince Sterne holds a tight rein over «Fortem», Prince Mont's division, «Caelum», is frequently described as a motley crew. One reason for this is Mont's overt kindness and oft-mocked method of selecting soldiers. While the division's commander, Lilyth, is a skilled warrior known as the Blaze of the Battlefield, both the overproud Baelo and archer Learte are Mont's childhood playmates. Factoring in Ramada—part tactician, part astrologer—there are many who decry the main members' paltry wartime experience. Yet rather than hold the front lines, «Caelum» acts as an adaptive unit. Where the members lack in fighting power, they make up for in their individual talents, and their bonds of friendship are rock-solid."},{"key":"VC_LW_TRAINING","value":"　Soldiers across the land fear the devilish swordsman known as Sir Owe. Leonis's ability to remain steadfast while surrounded by larger territories is due in no small part to Owe's countless military exploits. It was thus an easy choice for King Oelde to appoint him as the princes' sword instructor. The princes were polar opposites in both personality and swordsmanship, and Owe saw more of his past self in Sterne—a young man overeager to demonstrate his father's gallantry. He saw great talent slumbering in Mont as well, but he knew that only Mont himself could draw it out. Sterne is both motivated and astute, and he masters Owe's techniques with the same precision that Owe himself had. Though Owe saw Sterne's overly rapid growth causing rifts among the royal family, he turned a blind eye and chose instead to love Sterne as his disciple."},{"key":"VC_LW_MACR","value":"　An ancient relic that possesses the inexplicable power to summon espers. It was given to Machérie by her father, King Robb of Hourne, to offer as a trousseau in her arranged marriage to King Muraga of Fennes. The offer of marriage was suggested by Sadali, the founder of the Church of the Crystal, as a way of urging Hourne to ally with Fennes against the encroaching threat of Rundall to the west. As part of this arrangement, Muraga's daughter Vinera would wed Prince Dario, and Machérie would wed into Fennes. Though Robb rejected the idea at first, Machérie's own insistence that it would be \"for the sake of protecting Hourne\" swayed him. In truth, Robb never believed the necklace would leave the kingdom except for in times of war. Given that he entrusted it to his daughter, one can appreciate how deep his love for his daughter runs."},{"key":"VC_LW_MURG","value":"　Wielding a battle axe too massive for any typical soldier, Muraga takes great pleasure in the death and destruction he brings upon the world. He ends lives indiscriminately with each swing, and everything standing in the way of his advancing army shatters into pieces. He doesn't hesitate to light villages aflame, and the sight of him sneering as he slaughters the fleeing villagers with his battle axe is more terrifying than any monster. Nearly all who have seen such a sight never lived to tell the tale, and the soldiers of Fennes's army breathe not a word about Muraga. However, the screams of the poor souls caught in his onslaught are said to traverse mountains; those who hear them are gripped with fear, their minds flooded with images of Muraga's terrible wrath."},{"key":"VC_LW_GRSR","value":"　Glaciela, daughter of King Khury of the great kingdom of Wezette. She spearheads Wezette's army, bolstered by her years of rigorous training. However, both she and her father are aware of the smoldering voices hissing in dissent of her illegitimate birthright. Unlike her father, she does not hide her emotions. This often backfires while confronting the complex political issues of the kingdom, but when deliberations reach a deadlock, she mounts her chocobo and dashes across the snowy plains alone. Many have chastised her for putting herself in such reckless danger, but she has found no other way to uncloud her mind, and so she simply ignores them."},{"key":"VC_FF14_MV1","value":"Ala Mhigo is at last free from imperial rule, but that liberty may prove fleeting as the Empire moves to both reclaim this bloodied nation and subjugate all of Eorzea.

I wonder if I'll be able to give it to him this year...or if I even should?\" <br>Kitone turns this over in her mind again and again. The subject: a homemade sweet treat she hopes to give as a token of gratitude for being under his care. Since she has no ulterior motives, she should be able to boldly hand it over. Though even if she believes so, she wonders if maybe she overdecorated it, or if she might be thought to have other intentions, and so she always fails to give it to him. <br>\"I wonder if I'll end up giving it to Owe again this year, too...\" <br>Worried such thoughts might slip out on accident, she suppresses them in her head. She's certainly under Owe's care as well—that's indisputable. Still... Although such contrary feelings tumble around in her heart, she herself understood that she would fail to take action."},{"key":"VC_LW_SHIV","value":"　A splendor of a woman wrapped in an icy mist and constantly surrounded by dancing crystals. No soul can help but be instantly beguiled by her beauty, though many have met their inescapable fate in her frigid clutches.

Boasting a beard nearly as long as he is tall, Ramuh emanates a dignified aura that would have most any mortal trembling with fear.

Curiously, it is unknown just how far back the legend of Ramuh goes."},{"key":"VC_FFT_MV1","value":"　The noble House Beoulve has served the Atkascha royal family for generations, and it was into this renowned military family that Ramza was born. Members of House Beoulve have led the Order of the Northern Sky—the greatest military force in all of Ivalice—for generations; Ramza's elder brother, Zalbaag, now commands the order, following in the footsteps of both the eldest brother, Dycedarg, and their father, Barbaneth. Young Ramza, however, chose to distance himself from the order and opted instead for mercenary work. Yet as fate would have it, it is he who chances upon the princess's kidnapping. The incident ignites conflict between Duke Larg of Gallionne, who flies the banner of the White Lion, and Duke Goltanna of Zeltennia, who flies the banner of the Black Lion. Ramza soon finds himself swept up in the struggle between these two houses—a struggle that would later come to be known as the War of the Lions."},{"key":"VC_LW_ODIN","value":"　A giant astride an enormous six-legged horse makes for a heroic image, but Odin's stalwart physique is beyond comparison. Since ancient times, tales of Odin have depicted him in many forms—as a warrior, a mage, and even a king. <br>A single swing of his sword can split a rift through anything, even time and space itself. Those unlucky enough to taste his steel are unwittingly engulfed by a dimensional rift, never to return."},{"key":"VC_LW_TSLP","value":"　Four beautiful sisters who arrive with the wind. Though their heads already feature wings and striking plumage, they further adorn themselves with golden tiaras. Humans are easily mesmerized by the beauty of their feathers. However, as heedlessly approaching these sisters will incur their wrath, it is said that one must absolutely not go near them.

With features such as fire breath, claws, and a tail, it possesses attacking methods similar to other dragons, but what any challenger must truly be wary of are its two heads.<br>Jumping to dodge an attack from one head may result in being taken out mid-air by the other, or similarly, its fire breath may serve as a distraction from an attack by the remaining head.<br>If one has no choice but to face off against it, failing to work out counter-strategies to these situations will surely put victory out of reach."},{"key":"VC_FF01_DMAC","value":"　A dangerous mechanical monster that patrols the Flying Fortress, a place accessible only from a tower located in the vast desert of a distant world.

One night during the festival, Meriluke and Cherise build snow sculptures together. Meriluke finds a branch that perfectly resembles a stag's antlers and stands ready to crown the finished sculpture. Cherise carefully places a hat on its head, and Cadia arranges a scarf about its neck. She then hurries off to fetch Glaciela, excited to show her the result of their efforts.

Instead, the flower was the message―he would always protect her, even if she could never be his. Machérie understood, and could not help but weep.<br>When Engelbert learned that Mont and Machérie were ready to forsake their love for each other, he sprang into action. He would not allow this shroud of unhappiness to descend over Machérie's future, and with unflagging zeal he persuaded first the nobles and then Machérie herself that she need not give up Mont.<br>So with a soft smile, Machérie gives Mont a single yellow flower.

After meeting Viktora and learning what it means to be alive, she sought to live as a human being, and she cared little for which side of the moral line she stood on in order to do so. Continuing to live a life full of laughter would bring an end to her sorrow. Her only hope was to pursue living that way no matter where it might take her. <br>The woman by Luartha's side hopes that her friend's face will always be covered in a dimpled smile as she pursues the life she desired—and that she will be smiling alongside her as well."},{"key":"VC_LW_RSNC_01","value":"　The curtain of night falls.

Be it as it may that she has always been an outstanding swordswoman, it is not difficult to imagine how her intention to exact revenge on the king of an entire nation all by herself was a reckless endeavor. It is said that she devotedly pursued Muraga's ceaselessly battling military forces across cold climates and rugged terrain, seeking just a single momentary opening.

Though she adores them enough to stop marching while on duty if they are spotted on the wayside, animals take her hair and armor as a threat and run away frightened. <br>Kilphe, watching this unfold nearby, is aware of why these animals fear Oldoa, but she says nothing. It would appear that seeing Oldoa despair over being rejected by her beloved animals brings a smile to her lips."},{"key":"VC_LW_KING","value":"　Among the warring states of Ardra, there are four kings said to stand above the rest.<br>There is King Robb of westerly Hourne, with his vast dominion and great military might, who is known to be a broad-minded man. To the east is King Khury of Wezette, who is prudent yet high-strung and governs strictly over a frigid land, and whose kingdom has since many generations prior been in an antagonistic relationship with Hourne.<br>Between these two nations is Fennes to the north—ruled by the violent and bold King Muraga—and Leonis to the south—ruled by King Oelde, who has established a presence despite governing a small nation thanks to his resourcefulness and strategic ingenuity.<br>These four nations preserve a balance nigh miraculous, and while there has yet to be a major war to date, the equilibrium is now gradually collapsing as Lord Sadali of the Crystal Sanctum begins to take action."},{"key":"VC_LW_BLMN","value":"　An evil spirit that has taken the form of a moon. Red in color, it appears as though it has been stained with freshly spilled blood. Legends passed down through the ages claim it to be an omen of disaster, bringing misfortune and death to those who catch sight of it. <br>Unless the strong magical attacks emitted from its eerie smile are dealt with, it will easily reap the souls of its opponents."},{"key":"VC_LW_GUREN","value":"　«Rubeus», a band of brigands inspired by Glaciela who operate within the kingdom of Wezette. Though they are currently based in the eastern part of Ardra, their center of operations was once in a city far to the west, in what is now the territory of Rundall. This came to an end when they refused Jayden Rundall's sudden demand for their surrender a few years ago, leading them to relocate to the east after being suppressed by military force.<br>They found themselves treated poorly wherever they roamed, but ultimately chose to lend their might to Glaciela, who has risen up in the name of the people to defeat King Khury.<br>Their leader, Margritte, and the commander of their troops, Vadim, have gathered a contingent of skilled warriors and lay in wait, sharpening their blades in anticipation of the uprising that is to come."},{"key":"VC_LW_CHCB","value":"　Chocobos are the most intimately familiar animals in Ardra. Not only do they assist in the lives of people as rideable creatures, luggage transporters, and so on, but many are also kept as pets or even live as full-fledged members of families.<br>Mutual communication and understanding is possible if you have established a strong relationship with your chocobo. When it's happy, it will dance on the spot and chirp endearingly. And when you become sad, it will gently snuggle up to you. But if you hurt its feelings, it will turn the other way and refuse to listen; such are the behaviors of this exceptionally emotive animal. If you are considerate of its feelings and endeavor to treat it with care, then your chocobo is sure to do the same for you in return."},{"key":"VC_LW_MOGL","value":"　It's quite popular among moogles to dress in this attire during the snowy months. Rumor has it that a certain moogle became fascinated with otherworldly scenery shimmering above the Crystals and told all the others; now, this far-off land has become common knowledge among them. Though few humans have seen it, moogles are known to don animal-like costumes, making the already adorable creatures even cuter. They're especially popular among the children who receive gifts from them. It's believed that there is a moogle sporting red robes and a long white beard tottering around as well."},{"key":"VC_LW_FIGHT","value":"　Shadowlynx of Saiga, and Rairyuu of Gouga. Just like the hidden villages they hail from, which are known for producing talented shinobi, the two stand in extreme opposition. While unavoidable due to the fact that Saiga was brought to ruin by those of Gouga, it stems more so from Rairyuu’s relentless pursuit to eradicate the people of Saiga.<br>Rairyuu, who takes pleasure in the wanton butchery of others, and Shadowlynx, who would risk her very own life to carry out her master’s orders⁠—despite fighting for different reasons, even if time, place, and positions were to change, their blades would still be fated to cross."},{"key":"VC_LW_TNBR","value":"　In a not so distant land, when children stay up late or do not do as they are told, it is said that parents show them a tonberry doll and say the following: \"Where are the children who do not sleep? Where are the children who do not listen? Tonberry has a chef's knife, tonberry will gobble you up.\" <br>Most children scream and hide under their blankets, but perhaps as the doll itself is not threatening, there are some who instead punch and kick back at the doll. <br>However, it is those children who need to be more careful, for the tonberry is a monster that settles the grudges of its \"brethren.\""},{"key":"VC_LW_ASSASIN","value":"　Spies engaged in clandestine information gathering. While every country dispatches such agents of their own, those of the Crystal Sanctum pass relatively unsuspected, as they use missionary work and their healing services as a foothold for making contact with their targets. They are said to pervade all tiers of society on a large scale in every nation. <br>Two such examples of this are Xiza and Vistralle, who belong to Hourne's first division, «Solidus», and stand ready to instigate rebellion or assassinate people of importance at the command of the Sanctum. <br>While none can say what will happen when they reveal their true identities, it is not hard to imagine it will involve misery for many."},{"key":"VC_LW_GCAL","value":"　A gigantic avian monster whose each and every feather is made of ice, giving its body the transparent appearance of a statue carved from crystal and ice. It is widely accepted that the name Glacial means \"glacier bird\" in the language of the region it was discovered.<br>Some monster researchers have pointed out its similarity to the bird enveloped in blazing flames, the phoenix. They hypothesize that the two were once the same species, but through its inherit magical power, Glacial developed properties of ice and its current form as a result of adapting to the brutal cold. Despite still being in the realm of hypothesis, the high credibility of this gives hope to future research of the monster."},{"key":"VC_LW_APPLE","value":"　Known as savages for their crude behavior and love of indiscriminate butchery, Dorando and Gargas would kill anyone without hesitation. Yet even these two have a side they show to none. In a certain village lives a young boy called Nador—the son left behind with the passing of someone to whom Dorando and Gargas were indebted. The two doted on him as if he were their own child. It is not hard to imagine they shared a small piece of happiness as they chatted idly together, munching on their favorite apples."},{"key":"VC_LW_MRLT","value":"　A large monster with a torso resembling that of a human and a long serpent-like tail. It was formed from a culmination of the dark regrets of those who have died with deep resentment and hatred in their hearts since ancient times.<br>No longer even aware of whom it hates, fits of rage and loathing towards others now guide the blades of this monster to descend upon its prey.<br>It is believed that this terrible being has the upper body of a beautiful woman as that was the visage of the first woman to die with hatred in her heart. There is no end to the cycle of souls culminating as if drawn together by the strength of their shared loathing."},{"key":"VC_LW_OOOO","value":"　For those who pursue the arts of war, the samurai of the east are said to invoke feelings of something akin to admiration. Not only their incredible swordsmanship, heightened senses, and physical prowess, but also the very way they carry themselves with their mindsets rooted in deep conviction is considered a particularity of the east. Owe and Seymore are considered to be exceptionally skilled amongst the samurai, but there is a commonality of refinement they share—an unequalled love of the drink.<br>Engaging in nothing but light-hearted banter as they partake, neither of the pair look the part of a swordsman. However, from the moment they draw their blades, they release a commanding aura, almost freezing the very air around them. The two laugh it off, saying that it is just part of a swordsman's refinement."},{"key":"VC_LW_ART","value":"　It was exactly this time last year. Father had ordered me to fell the bombs that had appeared in the outskirts of our territory. Ramada was kind enough to join me, knowing my dislike for battle, but having Sterne there with me was heartening above all else. <br>The ring was given to me to keep me safe, but at the time I truly thought I would have no need for it. <br>...So much has happened since then. I could have never imagined the things that would befall Father, Mother, and Sterne. And there will surely be even more unimaginable hardship to come. <br>But I will continue on the path I believe to be right. I shall do naught but protect everyone I can and restore peace to these lands."},{"key":"VC_FF10_MV2","value":"Attacked by Sin, an evil fiend which sows disaster in its path, Tidus is transported to the unfamiliar world of Spira. Unable to grasp what exactly has befallen him and full of uncertainty, he drifts to Besaid Island. There he meets Wakka, and upon his suggestion, he decides to accompany the summoner Yuna on her journey with the hopes that he might find a way home."},{"key":"VC_LW_LILS2","value":"\"...Don't let it get you down, Etre. All three of us together, we're honestly more than a match for Lilyth. But the mock battle ended in us getting a thorough hiding. I've been wondering how it happened, but I'm starting to think that her strength lies in her powerful resolve—to wage her life and fight as Lord Mont's sword.\"<br>\"Yerma...\"<br>\"The day will come when Lord Sterne needs us, and we will have to put our very lives on the line for him. I'm going to find the strength and resolve to do that. Lilyth may be a mighty obstacle, but we can't let that stop us, right?\"<br>\"Thanks for cheering me up. I'm going to get stronger, too. And once we take down Lilyth, I'll marry Lord Sterne!\"<br>\"Hehe, that's the spirit. May the best girl win!\""},{"key":"VC_LW_CORL","value":"　The coeurl is a monster that is often described as an enormous leopard with heightened ferocity. However, the most conclusive difference between the two is the length of the coeurl's whiskers, which stretch almost as long as its body.<br>Its whiskers function as sensory organs, but the coeurl can also manipulate them at will as if they were some manner of tentacle. From these whiskers it can also unleash \"Blaster,\" a unique bolt of energy which it uses to paralyze its prey. It is considered to be a biological evolution of the leopard, with its long whiskers obtained as the result of adapting to survive in harsh environments inhabited by various large-sized monsters.<br>While it is not widely known, there have also been reports of coeurls dangling their whiskers into bodies of water to lure fish then paralyze them with Blaster before feeding, which has drawn greater attention to the levels of their intelligence."},{"key":"VC_LW_KRKN","value":"　A gargantuan cephalopod monster, octopus-like in appearance and said to have dwelled in the darkest depths of the seas since ancient times.<br>Possessing intelligence that surpasses human comprehension and the power to manipulate water, the Kraken is considered the ruler of the seas.<br>It takes ships that enter its domain of the seas as intruders, entangling them with its countless tentacles before crushing their hulls asunder. However, despite the existence of various paintings depicting this destruction, there are none who have actually witnessed the Kraken assail hapless vessels on the high seas. It is a monster shrouded in mystery even to this day."},{"key":"VC_LW_DMCM","value":"　A wicked, synthetic creature composed of the heads of a lion, a goat, and a dragon, with a snake for a tail. Each of these parts possess independent wills and move to compensate for the weaknesses and blind spots of the others, making it a terrifying enemy to defend against. As a result, even if a challenger were to dodge the lion head's attacks, they would still need to remain alert to the possibility of then taking blows from one of the other heads or the tail.<br>When facing such an enemy, it is standard practice to focus fire on and silence a particular head, but in the case of the Demon Chimera, leaving the remaining heads unchecked is a risk few can afford. Without an effective means of attacking each of the heads at once, it would be best to avoid fighting this beast altogether."},{"key":"VC_LW_IGEN","value":"　Serjes, the commander of Wezette's first division, «Equito», and Ygene, a soldier in the second division «Stiriae», have known each other since childhood. When Ygene joined the Wezette army, she hoped to be posted to «Equito», but on Serjes' request joined «Stiriae» instead.<br>This was so she could spy on Abbott, the commander of «Stiriae», whom Serjes knew was capable of betraying his allies at the blink of an eye. He also knew of Abbott's aspirations to ingratiate himself with Khury, usurp the position of «Equito», and proclaim the division under his command as the first.<br>The two old friends from different divisions would meet sometimes in a quiet hut in the forest near Wezette Castle. Ostensibly it was to exchange information, but the real reason was to share a hot drink and spend time in each other's company."},{"key":"VC_LW_WHDG","value":"　A beautiful and legendary white dragon. Little is known of its ecology, but one thing is clear―it is a truly powerful creature, with some even claiming that it can topple mountains with a swing of its tail.<br>One famous legend tells of a white dragon that appeared in a distant world. Many soldiers were sent to slay it, but each and every one of them was bewitched by the wyrm's divine appearance and slunk away, stripped of their will to fight."},{"key":"VC_LW_LICH","value":"　A vile spirit whose reputation transcends the borders of various worlds. In addition to possessing devastating magical power, it is capable of bringing instant death upon its foes.<br>Legends paint the Lich as a great sorcerer of antiquity, who, having wrought a ruinous curse upon himself to obtain immortal life, now spends his eternal days reaping power from the earth. It is said there are mages who exalt the Lich for his transcendental feats, venerating him as the \"King of the Undead.\""},{"key":"VC_LW_CACT","value":"　A plant-type monster typically sighted in desert regions. Its striking resemblance to the cactus—a succulent, water-retaining plant often seen in deserts and other such dry biomes—is what gave it its curious name. It possesses a spiniform structure much like the thorny leaves of a cactus, and when it stands still, it is nearly impossible to distinguish from the actual plant. There are rare instances of a Cactuar sprouting flowers like its floral counterpart; many a desert wayfarer has been shocked by these highly dedicated doppelgangers. Its eyes and mouth are uniquely hollow, and although it bears all the appendages that should allow it to walk like a human, no such sighting has ever been recorded. This is perhaps simply because it freezes when sighted and darts off the moment its would-be predator is distracted."},{"key":"VC_LW_ARMN_01","value":"　This monster's body is little more than an eyeball and a mouth. Attached to it is a horn, wings, clawed feet, and a tail. It is one of many monsters indiscriminately classified as devils, although it ranks lower in terms of brute strength. Though some may think of the Floateye as \"cute\" in a morbid way, it is in fact quite aggressive. It employs its claws with frightening dexterity and can be seen using them to wield primitive weapons."},{"key":"VC_LW_ZUUU","value":"　When it takes flight, this enormous avian parts the skies like a rising mountain and can be spotted in the air from leagues away. Just a single flap of its wings is enough to wipe a small village off the map—a talent that has earned it the fear-filled name of Storm Bird. Though the Zuu boasts unmatched strength in the air, it is not without its weaknesses. Its overly large size makes it clumsy on land, and it struggles when first taking flight. Keeping it grounded may be the only way to capture it."},{"key":"VC_LW_OGRE","value":"　A giant and bellicose monster with a penchant for torture. It is both feared and loathed by humans, many of whom simply call it the Man-Eater. Its enormous, muscular build—and according strength—is several times that of a typical human, making it a truly menacing presence for the people of Ardra."},{"key":"VC_LW_BOMB","value":"　A unique, orb-shaped monster whose levitating body is completely engulfed in flame. It features eyes and a mouth, but these appear to be constructs of the flame itself, brought into focus as the flame reacts to the creature's emotions. As its name would suggest, the Bomb has an explosive nature, and it often self-destructs during conflict. It would appear that this tactic is directly connected to the rage it feels mid-fight."},{"key":"VC_LW_BYLO","value":"　No attack is sharper for Baelo than his sudden hunger pangs. He's a lover of all things edible, and he's well aware that the amount of food he eats is noticeably more than the average man. He's teased quite often for his body size, but he pays no mind to such squabble when he could instead be focusing on his next meal. Regardless, Baelo is a forward thinker. He takes great pride in his strength, which he believes to be made manifest by the astonishing amounts of food he ingests. He propounds—to the exasperation of his companions—that this is his true way of contributing as a knight of «Caelum». Baelo is attempting to set many food-related records, although Learte stops him rather frequently. He goes through every meal a restaurant can offer, sometimes ordering dozens of the same dish at a time. He insists that such acts are also \"for «Caelum»,\" and he has no intention of stating otherwise."},{"key":"VC_LW_RART","value":"　Learte of «Caelum» is both an incredibly talented archer and a teenage girl enjoying her youth. Her mind wanders between her hair, her clothes, the accessories she's wearing, and of course the boys she's close to. She takes pride in her position as a soldier of Leonis, and she is ready and willing to fight for the sake of Mont and her other companions, but she also hopes that her future includes starting a family with her destined lover. For Learte, the precious holiday is a busy affair with much ado. As Leonis is a geographic midway point for trade between the larger surrounding kingdoms, the markets are always full of rare and exotic items. Learte usually ends up spending her holiday meandering through the markets, but her checklist of stores to visit is just too long to get through in a single day."},{"key":"VC_LW_RYER","value":"　Little Leela enlisted in «Fortem» two years ago after an incident at Leonis Castle. That day, the castle held an evening banquet to welcome noblemen visiting from abroad. In the midst of the frivolity, Queen Helena's tiara was stolen by a mystery thief. While the castle was in a state of panic, it was low-ranking Little Leela who cracked the case. With the exits sealed and guests jumping at shadows, Little Leela stepped forward to observe every detail of the situation, deducing that the culprit must have been someone in the service of the castle who knew that the queen would be donning her tiara for the banquet. After interviewing several castle servants, she ascertained that a debt-riddled nobleman had persuaded one of the handmaidens to fetch the tiara. Her successful sleuthing skills garnered attention, and just a few days later, Sir Owe invited her to join «Fortem»."},{"key":"VC_LW_VNLA","value":"　Though it may come as a surprise, the kingdom of Fennes had long been lacking in the field of tactical espionage. So, King Muraga established the Serpent's Den, a secret facility designed to cultivate shinobi by indoctrinating children brought there in the art of assassination. Vinera was one such child. When it was suggested that Fennes and Hourne would form an alliance via intermarrying, Muraga's eyes fell on Vinera's beautiful figure. To pass her off as the king's daughter, her knowledge of hidden blades and poisons would not be enough; she was also given a teacher who taught her how to dress and behave like a woman of royalty. The results were beyond Muraga's expectations. What stood before him was a true princess—charming, and yet still with a touch of innocence about her—who would be the perfect bride of a great kingdom's prince."},{"key":"VC_LW_RIRY","value":"　Rairyuu was a leading shinobi of the Gouga clan, but he has since sold himself into the service of Fennes. His decision to do so was most certainly fueled by the fact that Leonis and Hourne—rival kingdoms of Fennes—have employed several shinobi from the Saiga clan. The chance to eradicate members of Saiga was the precise reason Rairyuu allied with Fennes. Once that's achieved, he intends to parley with other kingdoms. Even since before coming to Fennes, Rairyuu has never trusted his employers. In his mind, nothing can be trusted other than cold, hard cash. He's dealt with employers who tried to weasel out of paying—and they paid with their lives. In the end, it's always about the money. If the day should come when he can't count his coins after the job, he'll no doubt find himself a new line of work."},{"key":"VC_LW_JOBCRYSTAL","value":"　Crystals contain countless memories and are used to summon forth a myriad of things, but this crystal in particular allows one to acquire only the essence needed to develop a job. The method of extraction is equally unique in that one need only carry the crystal into battle. Upon felling an enemy, a warm light emanates from the crystal and envelopes the holder, bestowing more experience than what could be earned from battle alone."},{"key":"VC_LW_LEONIS","value":"　The lion is truly a fitting emblem for a kingdom of the name Leonis. The gallant depiction of a lion rearing on its hind legs is a symbol of strength in Ardra, and for Leonis, it represents not only the name of the king but the very essence of the kingdom itself."},{"key":"VC_LW_HOURN","value":"　The vast kingdom of Hourne bears the bull as its emblem. Hourne is represented by the bull in both name and substance. Though the kingdom is plentiful in size and peaceful in demeanor, it would not hesitate to unleash a mighty stampede against those who endanger its people."},{"key":"VC_LW_FENICE","value":"　The snakes coiling around the sword on the flag of Fennes symbolize the power to attain victory in battle. Snakes have long been considered wellsprings of vitality in Ardra, with old tales of people eating them raw to attain that benefaction."},{"key":"VC_LW_WEZETT","value":"　It is said that the people of Wezette communed with wolves long before the kingdom was founded. It is no wonder that a wolf—which lives in packs to withstand the frigid north—would be the perfect symbol of the region's people."},{"key":"VC_LW_CRYSTAL","value":"　The Crystal is the ultimate symbol of miracles. After founding the Church, Sadali toured the land, healing the sick and wounded and working miracles for the destitute. There are many followers of the Church among the populace, but it is rumored that there are devout believers even in the upper echelons of society."},{"key":"VC_LW_LEONIS2","value":"　A smaller kingdom surrounded by larger territories, Leonis is composed primarily of mountains and woodlands. The castle's location among the jagged peaks provides exceptional geographic defense and more than enough vantage points for its deadly accurate archers—a matter which has led rival kingdoms to refer to Leonis Castle as the Impregnable Lion's Den."},{"key":"VC_LW_HOURN2","value":"　The royal capital of Hourne is a fortified city with the castle at its center and a sprawling town encircling it. Beyond the walls of the city lie vast farming lands and nature-made industrial regions, which together give Hourne the most national resources of any kingdom in Ardra."},{"key":"VC_LW_FENICE2","value":"　Located in the middle of a barren wasteland, Fennes Castle was erected by a community of vagabonds who had nowhere else to call home. There is but one rule in this land: the strong take all. As more and more come to challenge this rule—and succumb to it—the population around the castle continues to grow."},{"key":"VC_LW_WEZETT2","value":"　The territory of Wezette lies in the eastern reaches of the Ardra continent, and more than half of it is lethally frigid. Wezette Castle itself was constructed on the steep cliffs of a blizzard-prone region, making it nearly impossible for rival armies to approach it, let alone capture it."},{"key":"VC_LW_DYNVERK","value":"　The head church of the Church of the Crystal, located on the border of the kingdoms of Hourne and Rundall. Centuries-old stained glass adorns the sanctuary, depicted in which are two figures—one winged and one not—holding up lit candles as votives to the Crystal in the center."},{"key":"VC_LW_TRSV_01","value":"　One of two paired ancient relics which, if used together, enable the holders to communicate across vast distances. Giving the other device to one's commander on the battlefront allows for the swift delivery of strategic orders."},{"key":"VC_LW_TRSV_02","value":"　One of two paired ancient relics which, if used together, enable the holders to communicate across vast distances. Contrary to the Heaven device, the Earth device features a female figure, but there is no difference in functionality."},{"key":"VC_LW_MIRROR","value":"　An ancient relic that is said to be able to depict images of far-off regions. Adorning the mirror is a small figure of a woman with birdlike wings; resting on her arm is a bird of prey."},{"key":"VC_EXP_01","value":"　A translucent, egg-shaped container filled to the brim with a peculiar liquid. A closer look reveals several small bubbles gently rising up from the bottom. Using this egg allows one to enhance a vision card."},{"key":"VC_EXP_02","value":"　A translucent, egg-shaped container filled to the brim with a peculiar liquid.
