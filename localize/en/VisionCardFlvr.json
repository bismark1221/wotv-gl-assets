One reason for this is Mont's overt kindness and oft-mocked method of selecting soldiers. While the division's commander, Lilyth, is a skilled warrior known as the Blaze of the Battlefield, both the overproud Baelo and archer Learte are Mont's childhood playmates. Factoring in Ramada—part tactician, part astrologer—there are many who decry the main members' paltry wartime experience. Yet rather than hold the front lines, «Caelum» acts as an adaptive unit. Where the members lack in fighting power, they make up for in their individual talents, and their bonds of friendship are rock-solid."

It was thus an easy choice for King Oelde to appoint him as the princes' sword instructor. The princes were polar opposites in both personality and swordsmanship, and Owe saw more of his past self in Sterne—a young man overeager to demonstrate his father's gallantry. He saw great talent slumbering in Mont as well, but he knew that only Mont himself could draw it out. Sterne is both motivated and astute, and he masters Owe's techniques with the same precision that Owe himself had. Though Owe saw Sterne's overly rapid growth causing rifts among the royal family, he turned a blind eye and chose instead to love Sterne as his disciple."

As part of this arrangement, Muraga's daughter Vinera would wed Prince Dario, and Machérie would wed into Fennes. Though Robb rejected the idea at first, Machérie's own insistence that it would be \"for the sake of protecting Hourne\" swayed him. In truth, Robb never believed the necklace would leave the kingdom except for in times of war. Given that he entrusted it to his daughter, one can appreciate how deep his love for his daughter runs."

There are rare instances of a Cactuar sprouting flowers like its floral counterpart; many a desert wayfarer has been shocked by these highly dedicated doppelgangers. Its eyes and mouth are uniquely hollow, and although it bears all the appendages that should allow it to walk like a human, no such sighting has ever been recorded.

When it was suggested that Fennes and Hourne would form an alliance via intermarrying, Muraga's eyes fell on Vinera's beautiful figure.
